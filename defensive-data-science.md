# Defensive Data Science


## Ideas from [The twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/)

* Version control
* Dependencies
* Configuration
* Resource locations (backing services) as attached resources
* Stateless (pure) functions
* Logging
* Development & production 



Not included:
* Build, release, run (Strictly separate build and run stages)
* Processes (Execute the app as one or more stateless processes)
* Port binding (Export services via port binding)
* Concurrency (Scale out via the process model)
* Disposability (Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown)
* Admin processes
