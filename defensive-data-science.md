# Defensive Data Science

## Motivation for taking the course

* Why you need defensive techniques

## Ideas from [The twelve-factor app](https://12factor.net/)

* Version control
* Dependencies
* Configuration
* Resource locations (backing services) as attached resources
* Stateless (pure) functions
* Logging
* Development & production 


### Not included

* Build, release, run (Strictly separate build and run stages)
* Processes (Execute the app as one or more stateless processes)
* Port binding (Export services via port binding)
* Concurrency (Scale out via the process model)
* Disposability (Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown)
* Admin processes

## Ideas from clean code workshop

* Principles of clean code: readable code, naming conventions, etc
* Version control
* Linting
* YAML
* Testing
* Code reviews

## Other ideas

* CLI
* IDE
* Docker
* Why notebooks don't support loads of these ideas
* Team best practices (e.g. PR reviews)
